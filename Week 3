Week 3

Process Concept
  - Process is a program in execution, aka job
  - A program can be several processes
    Ex. Multiple users executing the same program
  - Program is passive entity stored on disk (executable file), process is active
    - it becomes a process when executable file is loaded into memory
  - Parts of a process (bottom to top):
    - Text: The program code
    - Data: Global variables
    - Heap: Memory that is allocated during run time
    - Stack: Temp data, function parameters, return addresses, local variables
      - Stack and Heap grow according to each other, Stack reads the instructions (code) and Heap stores the data from the instructions
      - Code (stack) and data (heap) are kept separately for security purposes
    - Why can the same program give the rise to multiple processes?
      The processes share the same code, hence it is just an instance

Process State
  - As the process executes, it changes state:
    - new : The process is being created
    - ready : The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
    - running : Instructions are being executed
    - waiting : The process is waiting for some event to occur
    - terminated : The process has finished execution
  - Time slice : Amount of processing time the process gets (time slot)
