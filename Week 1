Week 1 - Operating Systems

What is an OS?
  - Software layer between the user and the computer hardware
  - OS goals
    - Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier
    - Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

Computer System Structure
  - Computer systems can be divided into 4 components:
    1. Hardware
        - Provides basic computing resources
        - CPU, memory, I/O devices
    2. Operating System
        - Controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
    3. Application programs
        - Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing problems of the users
    4. Users
        - People, machines, other computers

What OSs Do
  - Depends on the point of view
  - Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance; don't care about resource utilization
  - Shared computers such as mainframes or minicomputers must keep all connected users happy
  - Dedicated systems such as workstations have dedicated resources however frequently use shared resources form servers
  - Handheld computers are limited on resources and optimized mainly for usability and battery life
  - Some computer have little or no user interface; such as embedded computers in automobiles

OS Definition
  - OS is a resource allocator:
    - It manages all resources
    - Decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
  - OS is a control program:
    - Controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
  - There is no universally accepted definition, usually everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system
  - The one program running at all times is the kernel, which communicates with hardware directly; everything else either a system or application program
